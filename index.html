            <p>The story of Hua Mulan has been told thousounds of times through poems, songs, plays, movies, or simply just a story.Her story first came from a poem called "Ballad of Mulan". Her story is about how she disguised herself as a man to join the chinese army. Her reason to do such a thing was because she didnt want her fragile father to go to war. She stays in the army for about 12 years as a man. She went home after her service. When she came home she found her mother remarried since her father passed away. Then she was discovered as a woman. A man from the palace asked of her to be his mistress. She had no choice so she killed herself.
